## What's Coming

This will be a curated collection of:

- **Business Model Templates** - Open core, freemium, consumption-based pricing examples

## About

Created by [Dorina Buehrle](https://github.com/dorinabrle) - CBO/CFO at Lemony (building [cascadeflow](https://github.com/lemony-ai/cascadeflow)), fractional CFO for startups, PhD in Business Innovation.

Coaching 200+ startups has shown me the same patterns: brilliant tech fails not because the code isn't good, but because the translation from technical excellence to business value is missing. This collection helps bridge that gap.
